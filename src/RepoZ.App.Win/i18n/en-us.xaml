RepoZ is showing all git repositories found on local drives. Each repository is listed with a status string which could look like this:

master  {0}   +1   ~2   -3   |   +4   ~5   -6   {1}7


master
... represents the current branch or the SHA of a detached HEAD.

{2}
... represents the branch status in relation to its remote (tracked origin) branch.
In this case, the local branch is at the same commit level as the remote branch.

{3}4
... indicates that the local branch is ahead of the remote branch by the specified number of commits; a "git push" is required to update the remote branch.

{4}8
... indicates that the local branch is behind the remote branch by the specified number of commits; a "git pull" is required to update the local branch.

{5}
... indicates that the local branch has no upstream branch. "git push" needs to be called with "--set-upstream" to push changes to a remote branch.


The following numbers represent added (+1), modified (~2) and removed files (-3) from the index.
The numbers after the pipe sign represent added (+4), modified (~5) and removed files (-6) on the working directory.

{6}3
... indicates that there are a corresponding number of stashed changes.

Please note:
This information reflects the state of the remote tracked branch after the last "git fetch".
You can enable Auto fetch in the RepoZ menu to keep the information up to date.

Note that the status might be shorter if possible to improve readability.
