# HOW TO USE
# ===========
#
# This file can be used to define repository actions and actions based on the file extensions inside of given repositories,
# so called file associations.
# Let's start ...
#
# Repository actions
# ------------------
#
# Repository actions are actions for the repository context menu in RepoZ. They always refer to the repository they are invoked with.
# Each repository action is defined in an own json block defining its name, action on invocation and more.
# 
# Example
# {
#     "name": "{OpenIn} Visual Studio Code",        // {OpenIn} is a placeholder, see "Noteworthy"
#     "command": 'code',
#     "executables":
#     [
#         '%LocalAppData%/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/code.exe', 
#         '%ProgramW6432%/Microsoft VS Code/code.exe'
#     ],
#     "arguments": '"{Repository.SafePath}"',
#     "keys": "Ctrl+Shift+C",
#     "active": "true"
# }
#
# Use either 'command' or 'executables'. If both are defined, 'command' will always be preferred.
#
# - Commands will not be validated, RepoZ is going to execute it blindly with the given arguments.
#     This is useful for system commands like 'start' on Windows or 'open' on macOS or other global command line tools.
# - Executables will be validated with File.Exists() and might not be visible in RepoZ if none of the defined executables are available.
#     This is useful if an application is known to be located in different folders (like Visual Studio Code) and require probing.
#
# Try to avoid absolute paths if possible by using environment variables like %PROGRAMFILES% or %APPDATA%, for example.
# On Windows: Run 'SET' in cmd.exe to see the list of environment variables you can use.
#
# Use the placeholders below to build repository actions with information of the corresponding repository.
# RepoZ will replace the placeholders automatically.
#
# PLACEHOLDER                           EXAMPLE
# {Repository.Name}                     RepoZ
# {Repository.Path}  (prefer SafePath)  C:\Develop\RepoZ\  (Windows)    or    /Users/awaescher/Developer/RepoZ/  (macOS)
# {Repository.Location}                 C:\Develop         (Windows)    or    /Users/awaescher/Developer         (macOS)
# {Repository.SafePath}                 C:/Develop/RepoZ   (Windows)    or    /Users/awaescher/Developer/RepoZ   (macOS)
# {Repository.CurrentBranch}            feature/CustomizableContextMenu
# {Repository.Branches}                 master|feature/CustomizableContextMenu|origin/HEAD|origin/master|origin/feature/CustomizableContextMenu
# {Repository.LocalBranches}            master|feature/CustomizableContextMenu
# {Repository.RemoteUrls}               https://github.com/awaescher/repoz
#
#
# File associations
# ------------------
#
# File associations are different to repository actions. They are not related to the repository itself but define a file pattern
# like "*.sln" which RepoZ uses to scan for files recursively. Matching files will be listed in a separate sub menu named after
# the file association itself.
# File associations don't support the repository placeholders from above. The only placeholder is the path of the matching files
# which can be referred to as {FilePath}.
#
# Example
# {
#     "name": "{Open} Visual Studio solutions",        // {OpenIn} is a placeholder, see "Noteworthy"
#     "extension": "*.sln",
#     "command": 'start',
#     "arguments": '"{FilePath}"',
#     "active": "true"
# }
#


# NOTEWORTHY
# ===========
#
# - You might want to use the placeholders {Open}, {OpenIn} & {OpenWith} for the repository action and file association names,
#   this allows RepoZ to translate "Open ..." to the user's language. The remaining part of the name will be moved at the correct location.
# - {Repository.Path}, {Repository.SafePath} and {Repository.Location} will NOT be wrapped in quotes by default, because some apps require different escape characters.
# - The first action will automatically get the Shortcut [Return], the second [Ctrl+Return]/[Command+Return] in addition to the shortcuts defined.
# - Recursive file scans for the file associations might be time consuming. Therefore, RepoZ will not scan for files unless the sub menu
#   of the corresponding file association gets expanded. This way, RepoZ makes sure that the context menu won't become sluggish.
